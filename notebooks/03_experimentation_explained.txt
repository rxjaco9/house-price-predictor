This script is basically an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting house prices, with some added automation and experiment tracking. Let’s unwrap it step by step in plain terms:

📝 What the program is doing
Loads the processed dataset
Reads featured_house_data.csv.
Splits into X (features) and y (target = house price).
Further splits into train/test sets.

Finds the most useful features

Uses RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) with XGBoost to select the top 10 features that best predict price.

Drops the weaker ones.

This ensures the models train on the most relevant data.

Sets up experiment tracking (MLflow)

If MLflow tracking is enabled, every model run will be logged:

Hyperparameters

Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)

Saved model artifact

Trains multiple models

Models considered:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

Each model is run with a hyperparameter grid search (GridSearchCV) to find the best settings.

Evaluates each using:

MAE (average absolute error)

MSE (average squared error)

RMSE (root mean squared error, more interpretable)

R² (explains variance)

Logs and compares results

Saves results in MLflow (if running).

Prints metrics for each model.

Plots bar charts comparing models on R², RMSE, MAE.

Finds the best model

Selects the one with the highest R² score.

Prints its performance and parameters.

Saves a YAML config file with:

Best model name

Its hyperparameters

Evaluation metrics

Selected features

⚡ Why is it doing this?

Feature selection (RFE) → To avoid noisy/irrelevant variables and speed up training.

Multiple models + grid search → Because we don’t know which algorithm is best beforehand. Testing several with tuned hyperparameters gives a fair comparison.

MLflow logging → For reproducibility and experiment tracking. You can check back later which model/params worked best.

Metric evaluation → To compare models on different error perspectives.

YAML config → Acts like a record of the “champion” model and its setup, useful for deployment or re-training.

✅ In simple terms

The program is:

Cleaning up the dataset to keep only important features.

Training and comparing several machine learning models to predict house prices.

Tracking everything with MLflow.

Picking the best model and saving its details for later use.
